Mod works but is not balanced.

The XML files are source files for the mod. They replace the file that that are named after in bin\data\data3.bar. The PERSONALITY file is placed in bin\AI3. Credits to the creators of the [Napoleonic Era](https://www.moddb.com/mods/napoleonic-era) mod for the DDT art files, which is placed in bin\art\ui. Also credits to @danielpereira for UHC, which makes this mod possible.
